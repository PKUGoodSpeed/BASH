The objective function is called by "./obj_func x y"

We first use "./draw" to draw a rough landscape of the objective function in [-20,20] X [-20, 20]

Then we notice that the function is convex and gets its minimum within [0,5] X [0,5]

Then we run "./ternary", which uses the ternary search to find the final minimum at: x = 3.251, y = 2.356, and f(x,y) = 21.754
